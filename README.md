# Welcome to the Nordcrit Labs Knowledgedump

This repository is a contribution to the community of scientists, engineers, digital explorers, architects, hackers and many more.  
Some parts are **AI-generated**, while others are the result of **hours of debugging, testing, and hard-earned findings**.  

We decided to share it with you so that:
- You might **save hours** of work.
- You might **learn something new** along the way.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute back!
